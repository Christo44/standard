# Encrypting Time Machine Backups
Time Machine Backups contain a working image of your computer at the time the
backup was taken. For this reason, encrypting these backups is important.

## First Time Setup

If you are not currently backing up the machine, follow the [Apple provided instructions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18852?locale=en_US) for setting up encrypted time machine backups to an external disk.

## Switching from Unencrypted to Encrypted

If you previously setup Time Machine, but the steps for [Capturing Status] show
that disk is _not_ encrypted, follow these Apple provided instructions for
[changing from unencrypted to encrypted](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18852?locale=en_US)

## Capturing Status

1. Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.
2. Click Select Disk or Add or Remove Backup Disk (if you have multiple backup
   disks).
3. Capture a [screen shot][iOS Screenshot] which includes the status of all
   Backup Disks.
