Project Management
==================

Just like our dev efforts, everything is in [constant flux to best serve our clients](http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/responsive-discovery/) around here. Many of us adore [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/). And we make [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/) work when needed. :) We dig using the right tool for each project. Although, when using numerous tools for a large project, it's helpful to create a [centralized repository of project information](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/master/project_management/base-hub.md). This helps everyone access exactly what they need when they need it.
