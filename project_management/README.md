##Project Management
==================

Just like our dev efforts, everything is in [constant flux to best serve our clients](http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/responsive-discovery/) around here. Many of us adore  [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) or [Trello](https://trello.com/). And we make [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/) work when needed. :) We dig using the right tools for each project. 

###Organization
To help counter the confusion that comes with using numerous tools and repositories for large projects, we find it's helpful to create a [Project Hub (centralized repository of project information)](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/master/project_management/base-hub.md). This helps everyone access exactly what they need when they need it and can help as teammembers join mid-project. 

No matter the tools, we aim to keep projects focused on goals, priorities, and removing barriers for the people doing the work and making decisions. Kanban boards, like the one we most use with Zenhub, are a great way to visually see priorities, estimates for levels of effort, and keep projects moving forward healthily.

We estimate work early and do at least weekly transparent reality checks of budgets, timelines and project health. We share those reality checks (typically via Basecamp) and keep you on top of where things stand so that you can make smart decisions throughout the project. Using Zenhub and other kanban boards, while working hourly and giving frequent updates gives you ultimate control over proiritization and how your budget is spent.

### People
Drew, Emily, and Melissa are our main project managers. They plan things, keep us on task, scope hours, and so much more. And Austin asissts project managers as a project coordinator.
