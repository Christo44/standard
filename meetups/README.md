Meetups

How to run a meetup at Sparkbox.

Website/Calendar
-------

 - Parking - Someone needs to speak with the autobody shop next door to find out if they are ok with people parking there, and we should let them know the schedule.
 - Know/distribute Topic at least 3 weeks in advance (to have it before prior meetup would be ideal, so we can also announce at that)
 - Include the topics list

 - Dietary needs.  (ask during registration, but mention in tweets)
